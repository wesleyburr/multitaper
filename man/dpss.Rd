\title{Compute Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences}
\description{
   Compute Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences for use as
   tapers or other applications. This function uses the tridiagonal method and exploits
   symmetry. Note the odd order tapers are normalized so that the slope at the
   centre is positive in accordance with Slepian (1978) and Thomson (1982). This
   differs from Percival and Walden (1993).
}
\usage{
dpss(n,k,nw, returnEigenvalues=TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{n}{A positive integer, typically the non-zero-padded length of the time series.}
  \item{k}{A positive integer, the number of tapers, often 2*nw for spectrum estimation purposes.}
  \item{nw}{A positive double-precision number, the time-bandwidth
    parameter.}
  \item{returnEigenvalues}{If true the appropriate eigenvalues are
    calculated and returned using the function dpssToEigenvalues.}
