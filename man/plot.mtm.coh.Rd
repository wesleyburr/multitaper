\alias{plot.mtm.coh}
\title{Compute and plot the multitaper magnitude-squared coherence.}
\description{
   Plots the magnitude-squared coherence for a mtm.coh object computed
   from two equal-parameter mtm objects.
}
\usage{
\method{plot}{mtm.coh}(x,percentGreater=NULL,nehlim=10,nehc=4,drawPercentLines=TRUE,
             percentG=c(.1,.2,.5,.8,.9), ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{An object of the class mtm.coh generated by spec.mtm.coh.}
  \item{percentGreater}{Prints the percent of the coherence function
    greater than the given values in the lower left hand corner.
    The values are expected in a vector representing the percentages.
    For example c(.5, .7) will print the
    percent of the msc that is greater than 50\% and 70\%.}
  \item{nehlim}{A smoothing parameter used in smoothing the
    variance in the final plot. nehlim is the number of points to smooth by
  on each side.}
  \item{nehc}{A smoothing parameter used in smoothing the MSC in the 
    final plot. nehc is the number of points to smooth by on each side.}
  \item{drawPercentLines}{Boolean variable indicating if significance lines
    are to be drawn.}
  \item{percentG}{A vector of values for which to print dashed lines
    indicating the percent greater than a particular value. If
    drawpPercentLines is FALSE then this will not be used.}
  \item{...}{Parameters passed to plotting function. Currently
    only tested with xaxs="i".}
