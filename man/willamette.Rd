\title{Willamette River time series}
\description{
   Willamette River time series. Each point represents the log of the
   average daily flow over a one month period from October, 1950, to
   August 1983. The sampling time is 1/12 year and the Nyquist frequency
   is 6 cycles per year. The data is from the companion code to \dQuote{Spectral
   Analysis for the Physical Applications} (1993) and was originally compiled by
   the US Geological Survey.
